### 🔸 **2. Machine Learning Models**

#### ✅ **Supervised Learning**
- **Linear Regression** – Predict continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression** – Classification model for binary/multi-class outcomes.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Classification using hyperplanes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Instance-based classification.
- **Naive Bayes** – Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem.
- **Decision Tree**  
  - Implemented using both **Gini Index** and **Entropy** to calculate information gain.
- **Random Forest**  
  - Trained with **20** and **100** estimators to observe performance differences.

#### 🧪 **Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Reduce feature dimensions while retaining variance.

---

#### ✅ **Unsupervised Learning**
- **K-Means Clustering** – Partition data into clusters based on similarity.
